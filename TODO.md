## TODO List

 * General features:
   * Support LookupItems for Class="" attributes
   * Support LookupItems for things like <thoughtWorker> or <compClass>
   * If we know a bit of XML should be an enum like Gender, we should be able to autocomplete and highlight in red
   * Don't fail it there's no Rimworld Scope
   * Maybe bring out own Rimworld defs if there's no scope?
   * Handle Defs with custom classes instead of Rimworld classes

 * \<li> handling
   * Can we look for, and try to handle, instances where it doesn't have a Type against it's List?
   * Reference **defNames**

 * Field list
   * Should we be checking that the field is public?

 * XML Autocomplete
   * Auto complete other XML Defs
   * Link to those other XML Defs
